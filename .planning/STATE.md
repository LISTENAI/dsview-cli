# Session State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-04-10)

**Core value:** Users can reliably capture logic-analyzer data from `DSLogic Plus` via CLI and produce waveform output files that are easy for automation and AI agents to analyze.
**Current focus:** Phase 11 planning — device-option-validation-model

## Current Position

Phase: 11
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan Phase 11
Last activity: 2026-04-10

## Accumulated Context

- `v1.0 MVP` shipped on 2026-04-09 and remains the baseline that new work must preserve.
- DSView source inspection confirms the relevant `DSLogic Plus` logic-mode options include operation mode, stop options, channel mode, threshold voltage, filter selection, and mode-dependent channel limits.
- `dsview-sys` now exposes an owned device-option snapshot with grouped channel modes, truthful VTH threshold facts, and restore-on-exit discovery semantics.
- Presets, repeat/loop collect behavior, advanced trigger configuration, protocol decode, and broader device support are explicitly deferred out of this milestone.

## Decisions

- Phase 10 option discovery stays behind a fixed-size owned C snapshot so safe Rust never touches live `GVariant`-backed pointers.
- Channel modes are enumerated per operation mode and use DSView-derived valid-channel metadata instead of label parsing.
- Threshold discovery is anchored on `SR_CONF_VTH` as a voltage-range fact, with legacy `SR_CONF_THRESHOLD` data treated as optional metadata only.
- [Phase 10]: Normalize automation IDs from raw native codes with fixed prefixes instead of relying on labels.
- [Phase 10]: Keep threshold as a fixed voltage-range capability rooted at threshold:vth-range and carry legacy threshold data only as raw metadata.
- [Phase 10]: Expose a dedicated discovery snapshot in dsview-core rather than extending Phase 9 capture capability types.
- [Phase 10]: Build a dedicated CLI response type from the normalized core snapshot so JSON stays authoritative while text formatting stays testable.
- [Phase 10]: Validate devices options --handle before runtime setup so invalid_selector remains available without hardware or resource files.
- [Phase 10]: Keep discovery rendering isolated to the new command so shipped devices and capture flows remain unchanged.

## Performance Metrics

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 10 | 01 | 8 min | 2 | 4 |
| 10 | 02 | 6 min | 2 | 3 |
| 10 | 03 | 3 min | 2 | 4 |

## Session Continuity

- Last session: 2026-04-10T10:40:32.061Z
- Stopped at: Phase 10 live verification complete
- Resume from: `/gsd-plan-phase 11`

## Immediate Next Steps

- Start `/gsd-plan-phase 11` for device-option validation work on top of the stable discovery schema from Phase 10.
- Carry Phase 10's stable discovery contract forward into validation without changing the public option-discovery schema.
- Preserve the shipped `v1.0` capture/export behavior while adding option-validation rules.
