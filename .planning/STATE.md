# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-03)

**Core value:** Users can reliably capture logic-analyzer data from `DSLogic Plus` via CLI and produce waveform output files that are easy for automation and AI agents to analyze.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — native-integration-foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (native-integration-foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Build the CLI in Rust while treating `DSView/` as a read-only submodule dependency.
- Initialization: Scope v1 to `DSLogic Plus` only.
- Initialization: Use VCD as the primary waveform export format.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Git commits are currently blocked because repository identity is not configured (`user.name` / `user.email`).
- Native integration path against `libsigrok4DSL` still needs proof before implementation planning.
